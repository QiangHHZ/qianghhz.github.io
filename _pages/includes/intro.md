# ☘️ About Me
Hi! I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by [Jinwei Dong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2dDrv84AAAAJ&hl=en) [(董金玮)](https://igsnrr.cas.cn/sourcedb/zw/zjrck/kygg/zrdl/201703/t20170306_4755253.html). Prior to UCAS, I graduated from China Agricultural University with a master's degree, advised by [Geli Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HewuvoUAAAAJ&hl=en) [(张戈丽)](https://clst.cau.edu.cn/art/2018/8/20/art_31196_581204.html), and from Henan Agricultural University with a bachelor's degree.
<br>

Now I am working on the **impact of climate & land use change on avian influenza spillover**. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [qiang.hhz@gmail.com](mailto:qiang.hhz@gmail.com)!
<br>

My research interest spans disciplines and primarily focuses on leveraging **state-of-the-art satellite**, **citizen science**, **epidemiological data**, and **machine learning** to investigate the **impacts of climate and land use changes on One Health**. Previously, I have also investigated the effects of climate extremes on agroecosystems.
